## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailswift 3.4
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

Using Tailwind CSS for the first time, it's simple and effictive in styling web elements. For those reasons, I'm incentivesed in incorporating Tailwind CSS into my future projects, considering its utility classes and as well as streamlined approach to building responsive designs.

A better understanding of default element behaviours and to recognise when to take them into consideration.
